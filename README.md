# Portable TeX Live installation

## What is this thing?
A simple set of tools for creating and packaging a portable TeX Live installation.
The penultimate goal as of right now, is to provide LaTeX support to AppVeyor CI builds
of [atom-latex](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex). And as such, the packaged
installation only targets win32.
